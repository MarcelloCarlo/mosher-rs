  ## **TODOs**
  

 - Add random or linear glitch to image.
 - If not possible for one phase random position glitch, try glitch,
   save, glitch layered process flow.
  - Use device TPM for random value generator.
  - Outputs a readable image file (Retry intervals until it’s readable).
  - Add custom string value as either salt key, or injected value.
  - For injected value either inject it as linear value or shuffle it on
   the image's binary.
  - For injecting, either direct binary injection or corrupt the image’s
   algorithm.
